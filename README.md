# Intro
This project is a vizualization of Hawaii Campaign Spending data for Candidates. It was initially created for [Civic*Celerator 2013](http://civic.celerator.org/).

Please note that this visualization is based on the official Hawaii Campaign
Spending data which you can find on data.hawaii.gov:
https://data.hawaii.gov/Community/Expenditures-Made-By-Hawaii-State-and-County-Candi/3maa-4fgr

But the data is actually pulled from a filtered/rolled-up view:
